# Course Guide

**CMSC 23 - Programming Paradigms** *1st Semester AY 2020 - 2021*

## Course Description

Major programming paradigms: imperative, functional, logic, and object-oriented programming. The first half of of the course is a tour of these paradigms. The second half of the course focuses on object-oriented programming paradigm.

## Course Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, you should be able to:

1. compare and contrast multiple programming paradigms (imperative, functional, logic, and object-oriented), and identify problems in which using one paradigm is appropriate over another
2. design and implement a class. 
3. use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.
4. explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype)
5. use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.
6. design class relationships that adhere to object-oriented design principles
7. identify programming problems in which an object-oriented design pattern is suitable, and implement the pattern in a higher-level object-oriented programming language

## Mode of Delivery

This course will be delivered asynchronously through lecture notes with accompanying lecture videos. This course can also be found online on VLE. We wont be having scheduled zoom sessions but you're free to setup consultation on the scheduled times for this class.

Most of the work for this course would be dedicated to the lab exercises. 

### Enrolling through VLE

Look for the course [Programming Paradigms](https://vle.upcebu.edu.ph/course/view.php?id=185) in VLE and enroll yourself to the course. Make sure you enroll using the correct enrollment key for your section:

- Section A - **sectiona2020**
- Section B - **sectionb2020**
- Section C - **sectionc2020**

### Joining the Slack workspace

Make sure to join the [slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/up-4zo6452/shared_invite/zt-h0vbp2du-PAaMMZ5jr8C1NIo2odcAjg) as soon as you can.

### Asking Questions and Scheduling Remote Consultations

I'll try to make myself available for questions most of the time but you'll have a better chance of reaching me during our schedules for lec and lab. You can schedule consultation as a group. Use that time to ask questions about the lecture or ask for help in answering lab exercises.

You can contact me through sms, email, slack dms, or through discord. You can find ways to reach me at the last section of this guide.

## Course Materials

All of the resources in this course can be found in the course pack. The course pack includes:

- **Lecture Notes** - You'll find these in the PDF file called *textbook.pdf*. 
- **Lecture Videos** - There's a link to the youtube playlist here. If you want the master copies (not really super high quality but they're uncompressed version, you can find it here.)
- **Lab Exercise guides** - Not really lab exercises since you'll be doing it at home, You can find them on the textbook as well.
- **Some sample code** - Some code that I use in class
- **PowerPoint Presentations** - will not really be useful since the lecture notes are way more detailed
- **Installs for Haskell, Prolog and Python** - Includes instructions for installation

## Study Schedule

This class is asynchronous, but if you start too late, you might end up getting overwhelmed by the amount of work. Here's the recommended schedule for completing the resources and lab exercises.

I wont be able to immediately correct your lab exercises and write feedback every time there is a new submission but if you do want me to check out your work if it's correct or if you're on the right track, feel free to reach out and I will look at it. Just message me since I wont be able to notice every new submission in vle.

## About the Instructor

You know me. Its your CMSC 56 or 57 teacher. I've developed and taught this course for the first time last last year (enjoy some of the drawings I made just for this course). This is the third time I'm delivering this course. This course might be a little rough around the edges sometimes and it may lack some refinement, but I love teaching this course. When this was implemented face to face I saw my students enjoy the lab exercises in some form. To be honest I'm kind of disappointed that I wont be physically present while you're working on the lab exercises. But, don't worry I will try my best to help you remotely if you have issues in your code or something. 

Let's be understanding of each other in these strange times.
