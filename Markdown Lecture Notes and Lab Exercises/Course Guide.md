# Course Guide

**CMSC 23 - Programming Paradigms** *1st Semester AY 2025 - 2026*

## Course Description

Major programming paradigms: imperative, functional, logic, and object-oriented programming. The first half of of the course is a tour of these paradigms. The second half of the course focuses on object-oriented programming paradigm.

## Course Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, you should be able to:

1. compare and contrast multiple programming paradigms (imperative, functional, logic, and object-oriented), and identify problems in which using one paradigm is appropriate over another
2. design and implement a class. 
3. use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.
4. explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype)
5. use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.
6. design class relationships that adhere to object-oriented design principles
7. identify programming problems in which an object-oriented design pattern is suitable, and implement the pattern in a higher-level object-oriented programming language

## Mode of Delivery

Lectures are delivered face to face during lecture schedules. There are lecture videos available but some of them are not updated. On cases where we cannot meet face to face, I will announce if a substitute asynchronous/remote session will be held.

### Enrolling through UVEC

Look for the course [Programming Paradigms](https://uvec.upcebu.edu.ph/course/view.php?id=185) in UVEC and enroll yourself to the course. Make sure you enroll using the correct enrollment key for your section:

- Section A - **sectiona2025**
- Section B - **sectionb2025**
- Section C - **sectionc2025**

### Asking Questions and Scheduling Remote Consultations

I'll try to make myself available for questions most of the time but you'll have a better chance of reaching me during our schedules for lec and lab. You can schedule consultation as a group. Use that time to ask questions about the lecture or ask for help in answering lab exercises.

You can contact me through sms, email, slack dms, or through discord. You can find ways to reach me at the last section of this guide.

## Course Materials

All of the resources in this course can be found in the course pack. The course pack includes:

- **Lecture Notes** - You'll find these in the PDF file called *textbook.pdf*. 
- **Lecture Videos** - Lecture videos are available although they may not be complete or updated.
- **Lab Exercise guides** - Not really lab exercises since you'll be doing it at home, You can find them on the textbook as well.
- **Some sample code** - Some code used during live coding demos
- **Presentations** - Presentations used in class

## Course Requirements

There will be no exams in this course, 100% of your grades will come from the lab exercises. 

### Lab Exercises

All lab exercises are available in UVEC. Lab exercises must be submitted at the end of the lab sessions the exercises are scheduled for. Lab exercises submitted after the deadline but within the day will have a 10% deduction (10% of the perfect score). Lab exercises submitted after the day will have a 20% deduction per day. Lab exercises submitted one week after the deadline will not be accepted.

Please let me know if you encounter any issues in submitting the lab exercises.

- Lab Exercise 1 (Imperative Programming Review)
- Lab Exercise 2 (Introduction to Haskell)
- Lab Exercise 3 (Higher Order Functions in Haskell)
- Lab Exercise 4 (Drama in the Clue Mansion)
- Lab Exercise 5 (Snakes)
- Lab Exercise 6 (Library System)
- Lab Exercise 7 (Designing an OOP System from Scratch)
- Lab Exercise 8 (Factory Method)
- Lab Exercise 9 (Abstract Factory)
- Lab Exercise 10 (Strategy)
- Lab Exercise 11 (State)
- Lab Exercise 12 (Command)
- Lab Exercise 13 (Observer)
- Lab Exercise 14 (Template)
- Lab Exercise 15 (Iterator)
- Lab Exercise 16 (Decorator)
- Lab Exercise 17 (Adapter)
