1. The following code produces a number of  distinct of states . Show the values stored in each variable for each state (including the starting state):

   ```c
   int x = 3;
   int y = x;
   int z = x + y;
   if (x > y){
       x = x + 1;
   }
   else{
       printf("%d", &x+1)
   }
   ```

2. Why is the imperative paradigm called "imperative"?
